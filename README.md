# Arduino & Raspberry Pi driver for nRF24L01(+) 2.4GHz Wireless Transceiver

_This is the culmination of work by many people all working towards making it easier to use the cheap nRF24L01(+) modules.
This particular repo contains Arduino, RPi C++ and RPi Python implementations for versatility._

Please refer to individual folders for more information.
Guides for possible usage of these modules can be found on my website, [http://www.jonathongrigg.com]()

Where to buy
------------
I have had great success buying off [eBay](http://www.ebay.com.au/sch/i.html?&_nkw=nrf24l01%2B&_sop=2), where modules with PCB antennas can be had for around $1.50 each!

More powerful modules with external antennas can be had for ~$10 also on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com.au/sch/i.html?_nkw=nrf24l01+pa+lna&_sop=2)
